# Blender-pix2vox
## Giulio Mezzotero & Francesco Silvi

Starting from the [Pix2Vox](https://github.com/hzxie/Pix2Vox) we implemented an add-on to have the 3D network output ready to use for modeling inside Blender. 
To use the add-on you need to: 

1) Download the zip from this Git and installing the add-on file inside Blender add-ons section 
2) Download the weights from [Pix2Vox-A](https://gateway.infinitescript.com/?fileName=Pix2Vox-A-ShapeNet.pth)
3) Insert in the add-on (Tools: Pix2Blender): the Input Image folder (3 are provided in this Git to test it), the Core folder and the Weights file.
